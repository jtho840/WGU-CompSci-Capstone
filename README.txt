This is the demonstration implementation of my proposed machine learning solution for Timeless Pages Booksellers. 

The command line interface can be called up by running main.py and following the prompts.

For purposes of this project, the customer CSV has ten customers and their purchase histories. The ID's of these customers are 150-159, and any of these numbers will produce a valid output. 

Error handlers for invalid inputs, such as a non existent customer number and a non-number input, are present as well.

Images of the program and its machine learning methods can be found in the Snapshots folder.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract the contents of JDT_Capstone_Project.zip.
2. In the folder, run main.py to start the command line interface.
3. Enter a customer ID number to create a profile and get recommendations for that customer. (Only numbers 150-159 are present in the simulated database, any other integer will not find a customer.)
4. The program will output the recommendations for the customer once their ID is validated. To find another customer’s recommendations, enter their ID when prompted. The search can be repeated indefinitely with different customers.
5. To end the program, enter “Exit” instead of a customer ID. This will close the program.
